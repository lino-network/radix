# Radix

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mediocregopher/radix.v3)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mediocregopher/radix.v3)
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mediocregopher/radix.v3?status.svg)][godoc]

Radix is a full-featured [Redis][redis] client for Go. See the [GoDoc][godoc]
for documentation and general usage examples.

_*THIS PROJECT IS IN BETA. THE TESTS ALL PASS, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN ANY
KIND OF PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT YET. THE API IS GENERALLY STABLE, THOUGH I MAY
MAKE MINOR CHANGES STILL. ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED!*_

## Installation

    go get github.com/mediocregopher/radix.v3

## Testing

    # requires a redis server running on 127.0.0.1:6379
    go test github.com/mediocregopher/radix.v3

## Features

* Standard print-like API which supports all current and future redis commands

* Support for using an io.Reader as a command argument and writing responses to
  an io.Writer.

* Connection pooling

* Helpers for [EVAL][eval], [SCAN][scan], and [pipelining][pipelining]

* Support for [pubsub][pubsub], as well as persistent pubsub wherein if a
  connection is lost a new one transparently replaces it.

* Full support for [sentinel][sentinel] and [cluster][cluster]

* Nearly all important types are interfaces, allowing for custom implementations
  of nearly anything.

## Benchmarks

As of writing redigo and radix.v3 are fairly comparable, with radix being a
couple microseconds slower on average. This is in exchange for being
significantly more flexible in most use-cases, but nevertheless is an area for
future improvement.
